[{"title":"Listener panel study update","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"blog/Listener panel study update","content":"We have two major updates from the Cadenza project. First, we completed the sensory panel study in which our participants with hearing loss developed audio quality scales for use in our listening experiments. We presented our study findings at the International Conference of Music Perception and Cognition (ICMPC) in Tokyo, Japan in August and at the Basic Auditory Science (BAS) conference in London in September. Second, the entrants in the First Cadenza Challenge have now submitted systems they devised to improve the audio quality of various music samples. These samples have been tailored for the hearing profiles of our listener panel participants and are currently being prepared for our online software. We will be releasing the main online listening experiment over the coming days! On 20th September, we ran a webinar for our listener panel. In the first part, we gave a short talk summarising the aims and results of the sensory panel study. You can watch the recording of this event in the next video. Our thanks to the challenge entrants for their submissions!","keywords":""},{"title":"Sensory evaluation study","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"blog/Sensory evaluation study","content":"Here at Cadenza our sensory evaluation work to define audio quality for hearing impaired listeners is underway. We want to understand better how hearing-impaired listeners perceive audio quality in music and develop quality metrics that will subsequently be used by our listener panel to rate the systems submitted by challenge entrants. Through careful listening tasks and group discussion, the sensory panel will arrive at a consensus about important sound quality attributes and how these should be measured. You can find out more about this process on the Sensory Evaluation page. The first task was an individual elicitation task in which we asked twelve listeners with hearing impairment to provide single-word perceptual terms to describe various music excerpts provided to them. This resulted in hundreds of unique attributes used to describe sound quality, of which 89 were used more than four times (see Fig. 1) and 87 were used two or three times (see Fig. 2). This provided the starting point for the first Focus group which sought to identify the most important attributes and to identify ways of grouping the attributes into perceptual dimensions that could be captured in the quality metric. The outcome of Focus group one was a spatial mapping of the ways in which the panel grouped attributes together which was used as a starting point for Focus group two (see Fig. 3). The panel then discussed further the meaning and grouping of different terms to reach consensus about important dimensions. In February, we will carry out a third Focus group to arrive at final dimensions, how these can be defined, and how they can be rated or scored in the challenges. We would like to thank our Sensory panel group for their ongoing motivation and commitment with this challenging task! Figure 1, 89 terms that were used four or more times to describe the musical excerpts. Figure 2, 87 terms that were used twice or three times to describe the musical excerpts.

Starting from 373 unique terms used by participants to describe music audio quality, a discussion process was completed as outlined in the image below: Figure 1, Objectives of each Focus Group session. At this stage in the work, we wanted to share the current state of these perceptual attributes and short definitions:Attribute\tShort DefinitionOverall Audio Quality\tPerceived audio quality results from judgments of the sound of the music, in relation to a person’s expectations of how the music should ideally sound to them. Clarity\tClarity refers to how well you can hear and distinguish between the different instruments and elements within the music. Harshness\tHarshness refers to an uncomfortable overemphasis of certain parts of the sound. It is most often heard in the treble resulting in a piercing, screechy or sharp sounds. Distortion\tDistortion can be caused by artefacts that shouldn’t be present e.g., noise, hiss, pops or crackles. It can also be caused by the pitches sounding wrong. Music with No distortion sounds like an authentic version of what was performed. Spaciousness\tSpaciousness refers to how much you feel the music is ‘coloured’ by the performance space, and how much you can hear the reverberations and sense of space. Treble Strength\tTreble strength refers to the perceived strength or prominence of sound qualities that are characterised by higher frequencies in the treble range, or similarly, sounds, instruments or voices with higher pitches. Middle Strength\tMiddle strength refers to the perceived strength or prominence of sound qualities that are characterised by middle frequencies found between bass and treble ranges, or similarly, sounds, instruments, or voices that pitches perceived as being between lower and higher pitches. Bass Strength\tBass strength refers to the perceived strength or prominence of sound qualities that are characterised by lower frequencies in the bass range, or similarly, sounds, instruments or voices with lower pitches. Frequency Balance\tFrequency balance refers to the perceived balance between treble (or higher pitch) and bass (or lower pitch) sounds. Our next steps in the perceptual research will involve further data collection and testing of these attributes, to understand which are the strongest predictors of overall audio quality. This is an important process as enhanced music signals submitted by challenge entrants will be scored on these attributes by a listening panel, and so the necessity of these attributes requires some initial testing. As always, we would like to express our sincere gratitude and thanks to our sensory panel group for their incredible commitment, motivation, and contribution to this research!","keywords":""},{"title":"The 1st Cadenza Challenge","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/cadenza1/cc1_intro","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Task 1: Headphones​","type":1,"pageTitle":"The 1st Cadenza Challenge","url":"docs/cadenza1/cc1_intro#task-1-headphones","content":" Someone with a hearing loss is listening via headphones, not using their hearing aids. As Figure 1 shows, the machine learning challenge here is to first demix stereo tracks into a VDBO (vocal, drums, bass and other) representation. This then allows a personalised remixing for the listener that has better audio quality. For example, for some music you might amplify the vocals to improve the audibility of the lyrics. To evaluate the quality of the demixing, the objective measure HAAQI (Hearing aid audio quality index) is used. The evaluation of the remixed version will be via our listening panel. The block that can be changed by you is labelled Enhancement in Figure 1. While the main focus is on demixing/remixing, we'll accept entries using alternative signal processing approaches that can improve music for people with a hearing loss. Your entry would replace the whole box labelled enhancement. Figure 1, The baseline for the headphone listening scenario (Task 1). For simplicity, not all signal paths are shown.

Levels​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Listening tests","url":"docs/cadenza1/Data/cc1_listening_tests#2-levels","content":"For safety reasons, we allow participants to set the overall audio volume so that the sounds are not so loud as to be uncomfortable. This means that we cannot be sure at what dB SPL the signals will be presented (and as we don’t have any individual measures of loudness recruitment, we don’t know how loud they will seem to the participants either). It’s worth bearing in mind that should your signals overall seem too loud to be comfortable to a participant, they may well turn down the volume themselves. Our measurements of PC-8 headsets: A 1-kHz pure tone set to unity gain (RMS 0.707) with soundcard volume at 100% produces a level of 99 dB SPL using an artificial ear with 2 cc coupler (IEC 60318–1).A steady-amplitude “ICRA speech-shaped noise” ([1] track 1), scaled to 0.3 RMS, with soundcard volume at 100% produces an A-weighted level of 90 dB SPL at the same volume level. With this RMS, the noise had 0.1% of its samples clipped. Accordingly, in the submitted signals, 0 dB FS should correspond to 99 dB SPL (at 1 kHz).  "},{"title":"3.

Listening test design​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Listening tests","url":"docs/cadenza1/Data/cc1_listening_tests#4-listening-test-design","content":"The listening test will probably have a combinatorial design so that each listener hears entries from each team. Subjects will evaluate the samples on 4-5 perceptual sliders:  One of these scales will be for perceived overall basic audio quality. This will be used to rank the entrants. Perceived audio quality is about well the music meets a person’s expectations of how the music should ideally sound.The other scales will be used to rate aspects of the audio quality. We have been working with a sensory panel to develop these, and the current short-list for the scales as of March 2023 is: Clarity, Harshness, Distortion, Frequency Balance and Spaciousness. This data will be used to produce an improved objective measure for audio quality for future challenges.  There will be approximately 50 members on the panel, and each listener will provide scores for every system, using a subset of the total music samples. Should a listener drop out from the panel, we will endeavour to replace them with someone with a similar hearing loss, but should that prove impractical we will reduce the size of the panel. The number of samples listened to will depend on the total number of systems, but the maximum listening time will be approximately 5 hours per panel member. Listeners will hear samples that have been processed for their audiogram only, or if we do not have audiograms for all listeners, then they will hear samples processed for an audiogram of the same type.

The music databases (blue box) are available in object based format, allowing us to create both stereo input to the demixer (grey line) and music in VDBO (vocal, drums, bass, other) format (red lines). These later signals form the reference VDBO signals that are needed for the objective evaluation using HAAQI (Hearing Aid Audio Quality Index) [1]. The demixing part is therefore a variant on a standard demixing challenge, except the quality of the separation is evaluated using HAAQI rather than a measure like SDR (Signal to Distortion Ratio). The audiogram metadata allows the music enhancement (e.g. demixing/remixing) to be individualised to the hearing ability of the listener (dash grey lines). The VDBO signals are remixed to give the stereo output from the headphones. It would be possible to use a simple remixer that uses the levels stated in the original music's metadata. But there is freedom here to experiment with changing the remixing to improve the audio quality for the listeners.

The time-domain system Hybrid Demucs music source separation model. This model is publicly available in theTorchAudio library.The spectrogram-based system Open-Unmix model. This model is publicly available through torch.hub. The output of the demixing is 8 stems corresponding to the left and right channel for each source, i.e., left vocal, right vocal, left bass, right bass, and so on. Then, a NAL-R amplification and compression is applied to each stem using the personalized audiogram of each listener. NAL-R is a prescription formulation for fitting simple hearing aids. This then creates the output stems. These output stems are then evaluated by computing the mean HAAQI score of each stem. For the remixing procedure, the baseline simply does a linear addition of the output stems. Your challenge is to improve the demixing and remixing blocks in the &quot;enhancement&quot; box. The rest of the baseline is fixed and should not be changed.  "},{"title":"2. Task 2: Car​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Baseline","url":"docs/cadenza1/Software/cc1_baseline#2-task-2-car","content":"Figure 1, The baseline for the headphone listening scenario (Task 1). The music database (blue box) provide samples as input to the car stereo and also reference left and right stereo signals for evaluating using HAAQI. Your task is to process the music taking into account the listener audiogram and also the car noise. You have access to the car metadata (e.g. speed), which will determine the power spectrum of the car noise. The evaluation starts by predicting the signals at the microphones of the hearing aids. The effect of the 'room' acoustics is simulated by applying Binaural Room Impulse Responses (taken from the eBrIRD database). The car noise comes from a simulator we provide. After the car noise and acoustic simulation, the signals are then processed by a simple hearing aid. This then provides left and right signals that can be used for evaluation either by HAAQI or the listening panel. Your challenge is to improve the car stereo ('Enhancement'). The 'Evaluation' is fixed and should not be changed. "},{"title":"2.1 Baseline system​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Baseline","url":"docs/cadenza1/Software/cc1_baseline#21-baseline-system","content":"In enhancement, the baseline system simply normalises the signal accordingly to the average audiogram of the ear with greater hearing loss. The system attenuates the signal and saves it at 16 bit resolution. In the evaluation stage, the car noise and car acoustics characteristics (HRTFs) are added to the enhanced signal. This signal is then passed to a simple hearing aid (HA) composed of a NAL-R amplification. The output of the HA is use for HAAQI and listening panel evaluation. caution An important issue to be aware of is the possibility of the hearing aid producing signals with an amplitude that causes clipping. When this happens, the system prints warning messages in the log file, including the track path and the number of clipped samples. More details can be found in the core software page. 2.1.1 Loudness consideration in enhancement​ The baseline enhancement system simply sets an appropriate level for the original music based on the music and audiogram of the listener. It isn't perfect and some samples still clip! Computes the level in dB LUFS (loudness units relative to full scale) of the original song, i.e., the song from the dataset.Computes the average hearing loss (HL) for each ear. Refer to measuring hearing impairmentresource to understand how this average is computed.Set a temporal target level according maximum average HL. If average is equal or greater than 50, set the temporal target level to -19 dB LUFS. Then, for every 5dB LUFS over 50 dB, reduce the level in an additional 1 dB LUFS.Otherwise, set the temporal target level at -14 dB LUFS. The final target level for normalisation is set as the minimum between the temporal target and the original song levels. Example: All levels are in dB LUFS Song\tMax average HL\tOriginal Level\tTemp Target Level\tFinal Level1\t35\t-13\t-14\t-14 2\t42\t-15\t-14\t-15 3\t50\t-15\t-19\t-19 4\t60\t-13\t-19\t-21 The levels of -14 and -19 dB LUFS were set according to Spotify standard. 2.1.1 Loudness consideration in evaluation​ For the signal passing through the hearing aid. The enhanced signal (&quot;processed music in above diagram&quot;) has the car acoustic characteristics and car noise added (See here). This then goes into the hearing aid, which is a simple linear amplifier. If any sample values exceed +1 (or are below -1) on the output of the hearing aid, they are then set to +1 (or -1). Consequently, setting the levels of the enhancement signals to prevent clipping at this point is vital. For the reference signal (&quot;clean music&quot;) passing to HAAQI, a simple stereo set up in a dead room is simulated: Anechoic HRTFs are applied to the reference signal to simulate the stereo set-up. This then gives the music at the listener ear canal.The reference signal is then normalise to the lower loudness between the enhanced signal after adding the car acoustics and -14 dB LUFS. This becomes the reference signal for HAAQI evaluation.  "},{"title":"3.

Therefore, we will only require for entrants to submit the 30-second segment from the eight VDBO.

In the case of an instrument was not active in the segment, we rerun the process until find a suitable segment. In the subjective evaluation (listener panel), listeners will be presented with segments of 15-second of duration. Therefore, for the remixed signal, we just require for entrants to submit the pre-defined segments. These segments were selected randomly.

We average the left and right scores to produce a final overall score. Instructions and recommendations on the use of HAAQI You can call the HAAQI metric using the clarity.evaluator.haaqi.compute_haaqi function as: compute_haaqi( processed_signal, reference_signal, processed_sample_rate, reference_sample_rate, audiogram, equalisation, level1 ) The processed_signal corresponds to the output signal from enhancement block in the baseline.The reference_signal corresponds to the amplified reference signal. This is generated by the evaluation block in the baseline.It is recommended to resample the processed_signal and reference_signal signals to 24,000 Hz before calling the metric.Set the parameters processed_sample_rate and reference_sample_rate equal to 24000.The audiogram corresponds to the left or right audiogram object.Set equalisation to 2, which indicates to HAAQI that the reference_signal has NAL-R applied to it. Set the level1 parameter to the level of the reference signal before applying the hearing aid amplification (NAL-R). Recommended to set it as 65 - 20 * log10(RMS(reference signal before NAL-R)) Note Please note that the level1 parameter uses the reference signal without NAL-R amplification. And, the reference_signal expects the amplified version of the same signal used in level1. "},{"title":"4.

This is done by using an out-of-the-box audio source separation system.Then, using the gains provided, the music is downmixed to stereo after changing the level of the different elements of the music.Next, the downmixed signal is normalised to match the LUFS level of the input mixture.NAL-R amplification is applied to the normalised downmixed signal, allowing for a personalised amplification for the listener using a standard hearing aid algorithm.This amplified signal is the output of the system: Processed signal "},{"title":"The Evaluation block​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Baseline","url":"docs/icassp_2024/software/baseline#the-evaluation-block","content":"The evaluation generates the reference and processed signals and computes the HAAQI score. First, it takes the VDBO signals at the hearing aid microphones (these are the VDBO components provided by MUSDB18-HQ with the HRTF applied to them) and remixes the signals using the same gains as applied in the enhancement.Then, it normalises the remix to the same LUFS level as the &quot;mixture at the hearing aid mics&quot;.Next, it applies the NAL-R amplification.This process results in the Reference signal for HAAQI, which simulates a &quot;listener preferred mixture&quot;. The reference signal corresponds to an ideal rebalanced signal when we have access to the clean VDBO components.As HAAQI is an intrusive metric, the score is computed by comparing the Processed signal (downmixed music) with the Reference signal, focussing on changes to time-frequency envelope modulation, temporal fine structure and long-term spectrum. Note In the Enhancement and Evaluation blocks, we apply a loudness normalisation (in LUFS) after applying the gains. This is to keep the loudness of the remix at the same levels as the mixture at the hearing aid mics.As required by HAAQI, we resample both the reference and processed signal before computing the score.

This means the signals at the ear that you have for demix is a combination of both the right and left stereo signals because of cross-talk (see Figure 1). This cross-talk will be strongest at low frequency when the wavelength is largest. This means that the spatial distribution of an instrument will be different in the microphone signals at the ear compared to the original left-right music signals. Stereo demix algorithms will need to be revised to allow for this frequency-dependent change. We will model the cross-talk using HRTFs (Head Related Transfer Functions), assuming the music comes from a pair of stereo loudspeakers in a dead room. Figure 1, The scenario. Although in the long term demixing on hearing aids would need to be causal and low latency, for ICASSP 2024 we are allowing causal and non-causal approaches. If you produce a low latency solution that will be great and very novel. There are increasing number of DNN approaches for causal signal processing from other areas such as speech that could be adapted for this.

Latest figures from the World Health Organisation estimate that around 5% of the population – or 430 million people – have a disabling hearing impairment (defined as a hearing loss of at least 40 dB in the better hearing ear) which could benefit from rehabilitation. This figure is projected to rise to 700 million people by 2050. There are many different types and degrees of hearing impairment, and a recent infographic developed by the Aural Diversity project highlights the wide range of hearing dysfunctionthat people can experience. At a broad level, hearing impairment is classified medically by the location of impairment, as follows: Conductive – impairments in the conductive path of the outer ear and middle ear Sensorineural – impairments in the inner ear and auditory nerve Central – impairments in the central auditory nervous system). These impairments cause different types of hearing deficits, One of the most common effects of hearing disorders is a hearing threshold shift or a worsening of people’s ability to hear quiet sounds, including the subtle details of speech and music. Impairments can also cause distortions such as smearing which can increase difficulties understanding speech and appreciating music.","keywords":""},{"title":"Download data and software","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/icassp_2024/take_part/download","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"A.

The interdisciplinary project was led by a small team and supported by an advisory board who were leaders in music psychology, clinical audiology, computer science, auditory perception, deaf education, and hearing therapy. The HAfM team obtained a large amount of original empirical data from &gt; 1,500 hearing aid users and &gt; 100 audiology practitioners across the UK and internationally. Results showed that whilst hearing aids facilitate music perception and appreciation, participants reported experiencing a range of problems such as pitch perception problems, distortion, difficulties hearing out instruments and hearing lyrics in songs, and difficulties in live performance contexts. Results also highlighted that the digital signal processing strategies applied to hearing aids to enhance speech perception can have a negative impact on music perception. For example, feedback manager can mistakenly identify musical stimuli (e.g. pure tones on the flute) as feedback and suppress it. Similarly, noise reduction strategies can mistake music for noise and suppress the music. Compression strategies can introduce changes to the sound level that can be too slow or too quick, particularly in music with sudden and wide dynamic changes (e.g. classical). Furthermore, there was mixed evidence for the efficacy of music programs implemented by manufacturers to help with music perception. Whilst a small number of participants reported being happy with their music program, a large percentage were not able to tell the difference between the music program and their speech program, or reported that the music program made things worse. Audiologists were asked to reflect on the strategies they used to enhance music perception. Many emphasised the importance of turning off adaptive signal processing features for speech, and they also reported using changes gain, compression speed and ratios. However, there were no clear patterns of what those changes should be, as some advocated increased gain at high frequencies whereas others increased gain at low frequencies, and whilst some audiologists chose slow-acting compression for music, others emphasised fast-acting compression to enhance music listening. Overall, the studies highlight that improvements to signal processing strategies for music for hearing aid users are needed, along with a better understanding of how novel processing strategies impact on listeners' experiences and enjoyment of music. This is one of the key aims of the Cadenza project.

This talk and the rest of the workshop are freely available online. Synopsis Hearing loss leads to several unwanted effects. Loss of audibility for soft sounds is one effect, but also when amplification is used to create audibility for soft sounds, many suprathreshold deficits remain. The most common type of hearing loss is a cochlear hearing loss, where haircells or nerve synapses in the cochlea are damaged. Ageing and noise exposure are the most common causes of cochlear hearing loss. This type of hearing loss is associated with atypical loudness perception and difficulties in noisy situations. Background noise masks for instance speech to a higher degree than for a person with healthy hair cells. This explains why listening to speech in noisy backgrounds is such an important topic to work on. A brief introduction to signal processing in hearing aids will be presented. With the use of frequency-specific amplification and compression (automatic gain control, AGC), hearing aids are usually doing a good job in compensating for reduced audibility and for atypical suprathreshold loudness perception. However, it is more difficult to compensate for the increased masking effect. Some examples of strategies will be presented. Finally, natural conversations in noise will be discussed. The balance between being able to have a conversation with a specific communication partner in a group of people and being able to switch attention if someone else starts to talk will be touched upon.","keywords":""},{"title":"Introduction to Hearing Impairment","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/learning_resources/Hearing_impairment/edu_HI_intro","content":"Introduction to Hearing Impairment These pages start with some general information about the various types of Hearing impairment that can occur.

These metrics have much in common with the metric we're using in the first challenges for music, HAAQI [1].  Click here for synopsis Signal degradations, such as additive noise and nonlinear distortion, can reduce the intelligibility and quality of a speech signal. Predicting intelligibility and quality for hearing aids is especially difficult since these devices may contain intentional nonlinear distortion designed to make speech more audible to a hearing-impaired listener. This speech processing often takes the form of time-varying multichannel gain adjustments. Intelligibility and quality metrics used for hearing aids and hearing-impaired listeners must therefore consider the trade-offs between audibility and distortion introduced by hearing-aid speech envelope modifications. This presentation uses the Hearing Aid Speech Perception Index (HASPI) and the Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index (HASQI) to predict intelligibility and quality, respectively. These indices incorporate a model of the auditory periphery that can be adjusted to reflect hearing loss. They have been trained on intelligibility scores and quality ratings from both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners for a wide variety of signal and processing conditions. The basics of the metrics are explained, and the metrics are then used to analyze the effects of additive noise on speech, to evaluate noise suppression algorithms, and to measure differences among commercial hearing aids.

In the Cadenza evaluation, the HAAQI function is configured so the reference signal has a amplification applied, so all frequency bands contribute equally to its loudness. This amplification uses the NAL-R prescriptive (gain) formula [2]. This prescribes the amount of gain across frequency bands to apply to the incoming signal based on the individual pure-tone audiogram thresholds at those frequencies (in dB HL) to improve audibility. This is linear amplification and no compression. A schematic for the rest of HAAQI is shown Figure 1. HAAQI involves an auditory model including hearing thresholds to allow for hearing loss via the audiogram and gain. HAAQI then compares the temporal fine-structure (BM Vib in Fig. 1) and the envelope of the two signals (Env) using correlation (Corr) and quantifying spectal differences. (The processes are similar to HASQI; see video above). The main difference to HASQI is the way the separate linear and non-linear terms are combined to predict perceived quality (&quot;combine terms&quot;). The metric has been shown to predict well the effects of additive noise (e.g., background noise and/or artefacts) as well as noise reduction, nonlinearities (e.g., compression) and spectral shifts. But it has not been used before to explore demixed signals, as is being done in Task 1 of the 2023 challenge. Figure 1, Schematic for HAAQI [1].

For example, numerous perceptual models of audio quality have been developed, such as the Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality (PEAQ), the Hearing-Aid Speech Quality Index (HASQI), and similarly the Hearing-Aid Audio Quality Index (HAAQI). These models can use software to simulate the human ear, auditory models, hearing loss, and hearing aid processing. Commonly, a degraded audio signal is compared with a reference signal in the perceptual models, and correlations between key audio features are performed to produce an evaluation metric of audio quality (e.g., ranging from 0 to 1). The HAAQI will be used to score your systems, but it is also important to collect data regarding the subjective perceptual experiences of listeners with hearing loss. Selected systems will also be rated in terms of perceived audio quality by a panel of listeners with hearing loss; the ratings used by these participants are developed through sensory evaluation studies. This will ultimately mean that signal outputs will be judged directly by those listeners that your system has processed for, and this subjective data can further be used to improve and develop on existing perceptual models of audio quality, with these refined models to be used moving forward in further Cadenza challenges.

Vocals usually “ride” on top of this mix, with slightly louder levels so the lyrics are intelligible. There is often the use of artificial reverberation to create intimacy and spaciousness. A sound engineer will carry out these tasks manually using her own experience. Automatic and “intelligent” systems need to implement these principles based solely on signal parameters and some “mixing” targets set a priori [1].

We used databases containing 100s of songs and, in some cases, multiple mixes of the same song. That allowed us to understand the “normal” distribution of signal parameters [3] which may be used to guide intelligent systems in the task of mixing multitrack audio[4]. There’s been numerous efforts in creating machines that can automatically mix audio tracks [5]. For this to work, a link between signal parameters and audio mixing processes needs to be established, and that’s not trivial.

We know that, in music productions, vocals are usually mixed about 4 to 6dB louder than the average level of the mix, with guitars as the next louder instruments. A mix targeting for someone with hearing loss might attempt to make the melody and lyrics more salient in the mix. The levels of rhythm back tracks such as drums and bass may be reduced relative to vocals and guitars, possibly with relative level differences going beyond the “standard” 6dB. Another approach might be to remix in a way to reduce perceptual masking from bass-heavy stems on other stems. This can be achieved by reducing the level of the former or applying some form of clever dynamic equalisation such as a multiband compressor. The position of each stem on the stereo image is also a factor affecting the listening experience. Positioning “important” stems away from other “masking” stems using panning in the stereo image will allow perceptual unmasking which will, potentially, help distinguish between the stems and create a more “spacious” stereo experience. This can be achieved if the underlying stems can be easily accessed through demixing. One of the problems is that, at the moment, we don’t yet know whether this will be acceptable to someone with a hearing loss or whether the nature of the mix, as intended by a producer, will be too severely altered.

If the system has access to the hearing loss profile, it can target a personalised mix which will be optimised for the individual. Level and frequency modifications can take into account the frequency regions where the listener has better preserved hearing. For example, if someone has severe impairment in the high frequency range, it makes sense to reshape the audio so that most relevant information (eg: vocals and melody) is presented in the mid-frequencies. For listeners with mild to moderate hearing loss, a simple balancing of levels of instruments to appear more prominent in the best hearing frequencies would make sense. For someone with severe hearing loss a complete remix where some of the stems are reduced more drastically will remove competing audio streams and present audio which is “easier” to listen to, whilst maintaining the fundamental aspects of rhythm, melody and vocals.

Here, an adaptive increase of those frequencies potentially masked by the car noise, as its profile changes through speed, will ensure musical components are less masked by the noise. Moreover, as the available source signal is in stereo, another solution would be to use a “mid-side” technique (obtained by summing both left and right channels to obtain a mid channel and subtracting them to obtain a side channel). Mid and side channels can then be edited separately with various tools such as EQ, multiband compression or even just simple level adjustment, before converting them back to the stereo left and right channels. A simple increase of the mid-channel allows all the instruments which have been panned centrally in the stereo mix, e.g.: vocals, bass, snare, to be raised in terms of their relative level. A mix that may sound too spacious and lacking detail for a hearing impaired user can be made more defined and focused on vocals by reducing the level of the side channel before converting back to a left/right mix.

It is a description by a non-expert, who however, comes from a career in engineering acoustics, both as a researcher and teacher. The Tinnitus has been of long duration (45 years), is high-frequency and broad-band in character, and is confined to the right ear. With the onset of presbycusis the Tinnitus became progressively louder, again only in the right ear. On the recommendation of the NHS, a hearing aid was fitted three years ago, which, after some adjustments, suppressed the Tinnitus quite well. A year later, a purchased digital hearing aid provided more control of both the volume and frequency content. However, the use of these devices has compromised my binaural perception, which I might be able to explain, but also speech perception and classical music appreciation, which members of the audience might be able to explain.

Hearing aids help people with hearing impairments by amplifying sounds to make them louder and clearer. Audiograms The audiometry results are represented by an audiogram: a plot of thresholds in dB HL (hearing level; dB SPL adjusted for our differing sensitivity across frequencies) as a function of the standard pure-tone frequencies. The audiogram provides a metric of basic hearing ability, helps visualise the impairment, and can also be an indicator for certain types of hearing disorders, such as noise-induced hearing loss. One of the primary uses of the audiogram is to set the amplification of hearing aids to provide audibility for that person based on a formula (i.e., applying gain that counters that person’s hearing loss at each frequency calculated from their hearing threshold at that frequency). Occasionally audiograms are equal across frequency, or show better hearing at higher frequencies, but by-far the typical audiogram for an older adult shows worse hearing at higher frequencies, sometimes by as much as 60 dB or more (see Figure 1 for examples of real audiograms). Figure 1, Examples of real Audiograms. It is usual to calculate an average across frequency to give a single-number value for hearing loss. Many rules for choice and weighting of frequencies have been proposed or used. We use the popular “four-frequency” average: the thresholds at four mid-frequencies important for speech - 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz – are averaged out to give an overall hearing threshold score, usually for the ear with better (lower) thresholds. This better-ear pure-tone average (PTA), has been classified into broad categories, as follows: Hearing loss category\tBetter ear average (dB HL)\tPerformance in Quiet and NoiseNone\t&lt; 20\tNo or very slight hearing problems. Mild\t20 - 34\tNo problems in quiet but may have real difficulty following conversation in noise. Moderate\t35 - 49\tMay have difficulty in quiet hearing a normal voice and has difficulty with conversation in noise. Moderately severe\t50 - 64\tNeeds loud speech to hear in quiet and has great difficulty in noise. Severe\t65 - 79\tIn quiet, can hear loud speech directly in one's ear, and, in noise, has very great difficulty. Profound\t80 - 94\tUnable to hear and understand even a shouted voice whether in quiet or noise. (Table from Humes 2019) In the following audiogram example, the person has a bilateral symmetrical hearing loss which would be categorised as mild at lower frequencies and severe at higher frequencies. Based on their four-frequency (500, 1000, 2000 &amp; 4000 Hz) average in their better (left) ear, this person would be categorised as having a mild hearing loss (average 36 dB HL). In general, hearing loss tends to be greater (worse) with increasing frequency for older adults and worsens with age at a rate of roughly 1 dB/year. Figure 2, An example Audiogram. The threshold values of the audiogram defines how much gain the hearing aid needs to apply, with the calculation typically done by one of a group of &quot;prescription rules&quot;, e.g. CAMFIT,NAL-NL2 orDSL. Note that the scale of an audiogram is in &quot;dB HL&quot; = &quot;dB Hearing Level&quot;. This is not dB SPL; instead, it's relative to an international standard such that 0-dB is &quot;normal hearing&quot; at every frequency. For background see Why the Audiogram Is Upside-down | The Hearing Reviewand The Quest for Audiometric Zero | The Hearing Review As noted by British Society of Audiology guidelines, 'the ability to detect pure tones in a quiet environment is not in itself a reliable indicator of hearing disability and audiometric descriptors alone shall not be used as the measure of difficulties experienced' (p. 27). Nevertheless, the descriptors provide a useful summary of an individual's hearing ability, and research shows generally consistent patterns of difficulties experienced (e.g., difficulty hearing speech in noisy environments, difficulty hearing out melodies/harmonies in music) within each category. PTA provides a quantitative measurement of hearing impairment necessary for use in the challenges.
