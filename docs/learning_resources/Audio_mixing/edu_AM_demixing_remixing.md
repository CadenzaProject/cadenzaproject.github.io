The [MUSDB18](https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/musdb.html) dataset is a dataset of 150 full lengths music tracks 
(~10h duration) of different genres along with their isolated drums, bass, vocals and others stems. 
The website also provides information on the 
["Compressed STEMS" format](https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/musdb.html#musdb18-compressed-stems) used in the dataset.

The [Open Source Tools & Data for Music Source Separation](https://source-separation.github.io/tutorial/landing.html) site, 
by Ethan Manilow, Prem Seetharaman, and Justin Salamon, provides an in-depth tutorial on source separation, and covers 
the main steps in source separation, including importing datasets and training models.

The [Deep learning for automatic mixing](https://dl4am.github.io/tutorial/landing-page.html) book, by
Christian J. Steinmetz, Soumya Sai Vanka, Marco Mart√≠nez and Gary Bromham, provides a comprehensive tutorial that serves 
as a starting point for researchers interested on applying the last deep learning techniques on automatic music mixing.
A video for the tutorial is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHUqXwsmua8).
