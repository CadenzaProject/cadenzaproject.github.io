# Measuring the degree of hearing impairment 

Audiologists carry out pure tone audiometry (PTA) to measure the degree of hearing impairment and establish whether hearing aids are needed. In PTA, listeners are presented with a series of pure tones in quiet (in a sound booth) at different frequencies (typically octaves: 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000kHz) and are asked to respond when they hear the tone. This enables the identification of the hearing threshold for the individual.   

# Audiograms

The results of PTA are represented by an audiogram which plots frequency against amplitude sensitivity thresholds across standard frequencies. Frequencies are averaged out to give an overall hearing threshold score, which is classified into broad categories, as follows: 

    Mild hearing loss (20 – 40 dB) 

    Moderate hearing loss (41 – 70 dB) 

    Severe hearing loss (71 – 95 dB) 

    Profound hearing loss (96+ dB) 

In the following audiogram, the person has a binaural symmetrical hearing loss which would be categorised as mild at lower frequencies and severe at higher frequencies. Using the [British Society of Audiology Recommended Procedure](https://www.thebsa.org.uk/resources/pure-tone-air-bone-conduction-threshold-audiometry-without-masking/), averaging across five frequencies (250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000) and taking the better ear, the person would be categorised as having a mild hearing loss (average 33 dB).

The values of the audiogram defines how much gain the hearing aid needs to apply, with the calculation typically done by one of a group of "prescription rules", e.g. [CAMFIT](https://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/hearing/cam2-cameq2-hf-hearing-aid-fitting-software), [NAL-NL2](https://hearworks.com.au/technology/nal-nl2/) or [DSL](https://www.dslio.com/?page_id=95).

Note that the scale of an audiogram is in “dB HL” = “dB Hearing Level”. This is not dB SPL; instead, it’s relative to an international standard such that 0-dB is “normal hearing” at every frequency. For background see [Why the Audiogram Is Upside-down | The Hearing Review](https://hearingreview.com/hearing-loss/patient-care/evaluation/why-the-audiogram-is-upside-down) and [The Quest for Audiometric Zero | The Hearing Review](https://hearingreview.com/resource-center/expert-insight/quest-audiometric-zero)

Whilst, as the BSA guidelines note, ‘the ability to detect pure tones in a quiet environment is not in itself a reliable indicator of hearing disability and audiometric descriptors alone shall not be used as the measure of difficulties experienced' (p. 27), descriptors provide a useful summary of an individual’s hearing thresholds, and research shows consistent patterns of deficits (e.g. difficulty hearing speech in noisy environments, difficulty hearing out melodies/harmonies in music) within each category. PTA provides a quantitative measurement of hearing impairment necessary for use in the challenges.
