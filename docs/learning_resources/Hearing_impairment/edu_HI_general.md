<!-- 
- Bit about intro to hearing loss
- state the obvious stuff: frequency smearing, loss of loudness etc
- talk about how hearing loss is complex and different, lots of different types (Aural diversity links)

Hearing impairment is becoming increasingly prevalent in society, which is impacted by the growing number of elderly people in the population. Latest figures from the [World Health Organisation](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/deafness-and-hearing-loss) estimate that around 5% of the population – or 430 million people – have disabling hearing impairment (defined as a hearing threshold shift of 40 dB in the better hearing ear) which requires rehabilitation. This figure is projected to rise to 700 million people by 2050. 

There are many different types and degrees of hearing impairment, and a recent infographic developed by the [Aural Diversity project](https://auraldiversity.org/infographic.html) highlights the wide range of hearing disorders that people can experience. At a broad level, hearing impairment is classified medically by the location of impairment, as follows: 

    Conductive – impairments in the conductive path of the outer ear and middle ear 

    Sensorineural – impairments in the inner ear and auditory nerve 

    Central – impairments in the central auditory nervous system).  

These impairments cause different types of hearing deficits, the most common of which is the hearing threshold shift which affects people’s ability to hear quiet sounds. Impairments may also cause distortion which may decrease speech intelligibility, particularly in the presence of background noise, and may negatively affect music perception.
