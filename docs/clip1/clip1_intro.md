To develop better music processing through machine learning, we need a reliable way to automatically evaluate audio quality.
For music with lyrics, this includes a metric to assess the intelligibility of the sung words.
Some songs are intrinsically less intelligible than others. Factors that can affect intelligibility include:

* Vocal style and articulation
* Song genre
* Mixing and production techniques
* Listener hearing ability

For speech technologies, intelligibility metrics have played a vital role in improving signal processing and machine learning, we hope the same can be achieved for music.

## Challenge Overview

Participants will build models to predict lyrics intelligibility from audio recordings.
The intelligibility prediction model will take audio as input and 
then estimate the score a listener would likely achieve in a listening test.

## What will be provided?

* A dataset of song excerpts, some excerpts will be provided as-is and others will be passed through a hearing loss 
simulator to mimic listeners with hearing loss but not wearing hearing aids.
* All samples will include lyrics intelligibility scores from listening tests. 
* Software and baseline system.

## Expressing interest
