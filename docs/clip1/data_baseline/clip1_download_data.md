To obtain the data, please fill in the form below. After submission, the download link will be available.

**NOTE TO TREVOR** After the data is ready, I want to check 2 ways we could share the data with Zenodo:
1. We can publish the data as public but with an embargo period (duration of the challenge) and use a share-link. I am not sure if the share-link will work as a normal public repo. need test.
2. Publish the data in a restricted repo so people will need to fill out a form to request access. This can be done during the challenge and made public after.
In this way, we could control how many people have downloaded the data during the challenge and for the challenge. 
This is info we couldn't collect in CAD2. This number could help us to have a better number of possible submissions. 
After the challenge, we can make the Zenodo repo public.
