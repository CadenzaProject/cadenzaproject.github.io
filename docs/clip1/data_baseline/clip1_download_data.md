import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';
import { TwitterTimelineEmbed } from "react-twitter-embed";

To obtain the data, please fill in the form below. After submission, the download link will be available.

* I want to check if I can create a Zenodo link with embargo and publish a share link. 
In this way, we can control how many people have downloaded the data during the challenge. Info we couldn't collect in CAD2
After the challenge, we can make the zenodo repo public
