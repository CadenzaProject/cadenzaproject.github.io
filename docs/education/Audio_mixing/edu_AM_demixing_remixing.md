The [MUSDB18](https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/musdb.html) dataset is a dataset of 150 full lengths music tracks (~10h duration) of different genres along with their isolated drums, bass, vocals and others stems. The website also provides information on the ["Compressed STEMS" format](https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/musdb.html#musdb18-compressed-stems) used in the dataset.


The [Open Source Tools & Data for Music Source Separation](https://source-separation.github.io/tutorial/landing.html) site, by Ethan Manilow, Prem Seetharaman, and Justin Salamon, provides an in-depth tutorial on source separation, and covers the main steps in source separation, including importing datasets and training models.
