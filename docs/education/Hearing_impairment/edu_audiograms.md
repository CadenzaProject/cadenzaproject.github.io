The audiogram is the standard clinical measurement of hearing ability. It’s the pure-tone threshold of hearing in each ear, measured in quiet in a sound booth. The procedure is standardized e.g., [British Society of Audiology Recommended Procedure](https://www.thebsa.org.uk/resources/pure-tone-air-bone-conduction-threshold-audiometry-without-masking/). Typically it’s measured at octave frequencies and important intermediate frequencies.The values of the audiogram defines how much gain the hearing aid needs to apply, with the calculation typically done by one of a group of "prescription rules", e.g. [CAMFIT](https://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/hearing/cam2-cameq2-hf-hearing-aid-fitting-software), [NAL-NL2](https://hearworks.com.au/technology/nal-nl2/) or [DSL](https://www.dslio.com/?page_id=95).

Note that the scale of an audiogram is in “dB HL” = “dB Hearing Level”. This is not dB SPL; instead, it’s relative to an international standard such that 0-dB is “normal hearing” at every frequency.
