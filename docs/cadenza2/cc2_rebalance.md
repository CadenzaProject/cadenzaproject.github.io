Hearing aid users report several issues when listening to music, including distortion in the bass, difficulties in 
perceiving the full range of the music, especially high-frequency pitches, and a tendency to miss the impact of quieter 
parts of compositions [[1]](#refs).

In a pilot study conducted by the Cadenza Team, we found that tools enabling users to rebalance different instruments
in a classical music ensemble are highly desirable for those with hearing aids. The second arm of the CAD2 taps into 
this issue presenting a classical music rebalancing challenge.

The following example illustrates how changing the level of one instrument can alter the listening experience. 
The piece consists of an ensemble of five instruments: Bass, Cello, Viola, Violin 1, and Violin 2, drawn from the EnsembleSet dataset. 
The first sample corresponds to the original mixture. The second sample is the original track with the Violin 1 levels increased 
by 6 dB while keeping the rest unchanged. The last sample demonstrates the original track with the Viola levels increased 
by 10 dB while keeping the rest unchanged.

## Overview

Entrants will be given a piece of classical music, featuring ensembles comprising from two to five instruments, 
and asked to rebalance the instruments for a short extract. The target gains for the rebalancing will be randomly created.
Signals will be scored objectively by HAAQI and subjectively by a listener test.

## Causality

We will accept causal and non-causal systems. A baseline will be provided for each case.
The allowed latency for causal systems will be 5 milliseconds, that is, systems cannot look beyond 5 ms into the future.
More information about causality can be found on Computational Restrictions section of the [Rules](Take%20Part/rules) page.

## Evaluation

Entrants will be asked to submit a 15-second segment of a song and will be score using HAAQI and an audio quality metric we are developing.
Note that this is not an exhaustive list of the metrics we will use, and we may not use some of the metrics mentioned above.
The definitive list will be published in July with the launch of the challenge.

Entrants are free to use any metric they may find useful during training.

### Listener Test

In the listener test, participants will be presented with the rebalanced signal and asked to score its audio quality.

At the challenge launch, entrants will be given random gains for development. 
However, using random gains can lead to a rebalance that listeners may not prefer 
(e.g., if the cello level is increased by 10 dB but the listener prefers the violin 1 increased by 10 dB), 
potentially resulting in a good system being scored poorly.

To address this issue, we will conduct a study with our listener panel to determine their preferred gains. 
This study will inform the gains used in a second development test, which will be released halfway through the challenge, 
and the evaluation set.
