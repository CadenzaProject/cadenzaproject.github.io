The Cadenza Challenges are about improving the **perceived audio quality of recorded music for people with a hearing loss**.
According to The World Health Organization (WHO), 430 million people worldwide have a disabling hearing loss, 
with this number increasing as the population ages. WHO projects that this number will increase to 1 in 10 by 2050. 
Hearing loss causes various problems when listening to music. 
It can make picking out lyrics more difficult, with music becoming duller as high frequencies disappear. 
This reduces the enjoyment of music and can lead to disengagement from listening and music-making, 
reducing the health and well-being effects people otherwise get from music. 

The 2nd Cadenza Challenge (CAD2) presents two arms: improving lyrics intelligibility while preserving the music quality, and
improving classical music listening by rebalancing the instruments according to the listener's preferences.  

## Overview of the challenge

The challenge provides participants with music signals and targets that represented the listener's preferences for an improved music experience. 
Participants are asked to process the music signals to achieve the expected target.
The challenge is evaluated using objective metrics and with a listener tests with hearing-impaired listeners.

This challenge extend from the [Task 1 of the 1st Cadenza Challenge](../cadenza1/cc1_intro) and focused on two 
music-listening issues for people with hearing loss. 

1. The first arm focus on improving the lyrics intelligibility of Pop/Rock music
when listening to music over headphones while preserving or enhancing the music quality. More details
of this Arm can be found on the [Lyrics Intelligibility](lyrics)page,

2. The second arm focus on rebalancing the level of the instruments from a music ensembles of up to five instruments to 
match the balance preference of hearing aids users. A more detailed description of this arm can be found on the 
[Rebalancing Classical Music](rebalancing) page

Since listeners may be experiencing live music, CAD2 will accommodate both causal and non-causal approaches in both arms. 
And, a causal and non-causal baseline will be provided. Further details of the tracks are presented in 
[Lyrics Intelligibility](lyrics) and [Rebalancing Classical Music](rebalancing).
