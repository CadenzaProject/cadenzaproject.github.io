Studies show that not being able to understand lyrics is an important problem to tackle for those with hearing loss. Consequently, this task is about improving the intelligibility of lyrics when
listening to pop/rock over headphones. But this needs to be done without losing too much audio quality - you can't improve intelligibility just by turning off the rest of the band! We will be using one metric for intelligibility and another metric for audio quality, and giving you different targets to explore the balance between these metrics.

This task could be tackled in many different ways using machine learning. A few examples:
- Within speech technology, there are many different approaches to improving speech intelligibility that have been developed. Can these methods be adapted to improve listening to vocals?
- Within demixing, technologies allow the separation of music into different components including a vocal track. This then allow processing of the vocals and remixing to improve intelligibility.
- End-to-end approaches allow the transformation of audio from one style to another. How can this be adapted for this task?

But we'd welcome other approaches as well.

## What is lyric intelligibility?

Lyrics intelligibility can be defined as to "_the extent to which a listener understands a singer's message_" [[1]](#refs).
According to [Fine et al.](#refs), there are four groups of factors that can lead to lyric misunderstanding:

1. Performer: includes _articulation_, _voice quality_ and _diction_.
2. Music-to-singer balance: includes _music genre_, _song speed_ and _composition style_.
3. Listener [[2]](#refs): includes _listener attention_ and _hearing ability_.
4. Environmental: includes _room acoustics_, _proximity to performer_ and _use or abuse of amplification_.

As listeners are using headphones in our scenario, environmental factors are not included.


From the first three factors, (1) and(2) are addressed in the task by including samples with different singing styles and background accompaniment. For example, in the challenge datasets, one can find samples of music tracks where the background is not prominent and the singing style is more easily understandable. This is illustrated by the following example extracted from the training set from MUSDB18-HQ dataset:

**Lyrics:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;my skin's falling off i'm breaking at the seeps  
&nbsp;&nbsp;he's holding me under and i can't breath

</details>

The datasets also include tracks where the singing can be more difficult to understand, either because the background level is higher than the singing level and/or the singing is difficult to understand. The next example, also drawn from MUSDB18-HQ dataset, illustrates how the background accompaniment can mask the singing line, affecting the intelligibility.

Listener issues (factor 3) will be covered by us providing listeners' hearing characteristics
as [Audiograms](../learning_resources/Hearing_impairment/edu_measuring_HI).

Challenge entrants will be provided with appropriate music datasets and sets of audiograms for training, development and evaluation.

## Task overview

Entrants will process part of a pop/rock track to increase the intelligibility with least loss of audio quality. Two metrics will guage the systems, one for quality _Q_ and the other for intelligibility _I_. The balance between the intelligibility and audio quality will be given by a randomly selected &alpha; (alpha) value between 0 (prioritise intelligibility) and 1 (prioritise audio quality). Thus the overall metric is &alpha;Q+[1-&alpha;]I.

{/*

Figures 1-3 show how systems might prioritise different aspects. Figure 1 is as system that prioritises quality and performs poorly on intelligibility. Figure 2 is a system that prioritises intelligibility. We're looking for systems like Figure 3 that improve intelligibility while maintaining good quality.

## Causality

We will accept causal and non-causal systems. Non-causal systems could be used for recorded music, whereas causal systems would also work for live listening. A baseline will be provided for each case.
The allowed latency for causal systems will be 5 milliseconds, that is, systems cannot look beyond 5 ms into the future.
{/*
More information about causality can be found in Computational Restrictions section of the [Rules](Take%20Part/rules) page.

## Evaluation

### Objective metrics
The plan is to score audio quality using either HAAQI [[3]](#refs), HAAQI-Net [[4]](#refs) or an audio quality metric we are developing based on the CAD1 results.

Intelligibility might be scored using Word Error Rate (WER) or other metrics such as Singing Adapted STOI [[5]](#refs). 

For intrusive metrics the reference will be the original signal with a corresponding amplification applied to the vocal signal to achieve the target intelligibility.

Note, we are currently working on the metrics, and a definitive list will be published when we launch the challenge. As most of these metrics have never been
tested under challenge conditions, systems will probably be scored but not ranked by these. Entrants are free to use any metric they may find useful during training as well.

### Listening tests
The systems included in the listener test will be selected using criteria such as the originality of the system or selection by a pilot listener test. Listeners will be asked to transcribe some short extracts as well as rating longer ones for quality and intelligibilty, probably on a scale.

{/*

## Evaluation

Participants will be asked to submit two signals per song-listener pair: a segment of 15-20 seconds corresponding to a verse or chorus of a song,
and a smaller segment corresponding a lyric phrase for transcription. Both segments may not correspond to the same part of the
song. That is, the small segment may be a phrase from the first verse and the 15-20 second segment may correspond to a chorus or verse 2. 

The first segment will be scored for quality and intelligibility. For intrusive metrics the reference will be the 
original signal with the corresponding amplification applied. The second segment will be score for transcription using 
the original text lyrics as reference. 

The system will be evaluated for quality and intelligibility using a series of objective metrics. 
Audio quality will be scored using HAAQI [[3]](#refs), HAAQI-Net [[4]](#refs), and an audio quality metric we are developing. 
Intelligibility will be scored using Word Error Rate (WER) and other metrics such as Singing Adapted STOI [[5]](#refs). 
Note that this is not an exhaustive list of the metrics we will use, and we may not use some of the metrics mentioned above. 
The definitive list will be published in July with the launch of the challenge. As most of these metrics have never been
tested under challenge conditions, systems will be scored but not ranked. 
Therefore, the systems included in the listener test will be selected using criteria, which can include the originality 
of the system or selection by a pilot listener test.

### Listener Test

In the listener test, listeners will be presented with the same both segments and perform the same three evaluations:
1. Score the Audio Quality of the 15-20 second segment.
2. Score the Intelligibility of the 15-20 second segment.
3. Transcribe the lyrics of the smaller segment.

The audio quality and intelligibility scores will be weighted using the same &alpha; used in the processing.
However, the listener panel will not know what was the expected &alpha; for that sample.
