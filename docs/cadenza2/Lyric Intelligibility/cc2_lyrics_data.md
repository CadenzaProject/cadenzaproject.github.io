## A. Training, validation and evaluation data

The training and validation data are provided at challenge launch. The evaluation data is provided closer to the submission deadline.

### A.1 Training and validation data

The dataset uses the transcription extension [1] of the training split of MUSDB18-HQ [2]. This extension comprises 96 manual transcriptions of English songs by
non-native English speakers, totalling 366 minutes of audio.

### A.2 Evaluation (test) set

The music dataset combines the English subset of the JamendoLyrics dataset (20 songs) [3] with the 46 transcribed songs from the evaluation split of the
MUSDB18-HQ dataset. We will tell you what part of the songs are required, the required value of ùõº and the audiograms of the listeners.

:::note

The evaluation set should not be used for refining the system.

## B. Metadata Information

### B.1 Listener characteristics

We provide metadata characterising the hearing abilities of listeners so the audio signals can be personalised. This is common for both tasks, so please see [Listener Metadata](../data_listener) for more details.

### B.2 Alpha

This gives the balanced between intelligibility and quality. It will range from 0 to 1 in 0.1 steps.
