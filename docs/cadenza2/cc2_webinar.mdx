The 2nd Cadenza Challenge (CAD2) presents two tasks where traditional audio source separation (ASS) models may not perform well.
For the first time, both causal and non-causal scenarios are considered in music separation.
Challenges include classical ensembles with a variable number of instruments, lyrics intelligibility, and various hearing conditions.

To support the participants, we are running a webinar on Friday, 13th September 2024, at 11:00 AM UK Time.

In the webinar, the Cadenza team will outline the challenges, rules, data, baseline, and tools available.
We will then hold a Q&A session. Everyone is welcome to join. The session will be recorded and made available online for anyone who can't attend the live event.
