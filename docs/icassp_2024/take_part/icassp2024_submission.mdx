## 1. What audio do I need to submit?

You must submit the following audio for all the signals in the evaluation set:
- The rebalanced stereo signal.
    - Predefined 10-second segments.
    - 16-bit
    - 32 kHz sampling rate
    - Compressed using the lossless FLAC compressor 
	- 0 dB FS corresponds to 100 dB SPL

## 2. Code

We encourage you to make your code open source.

## 3. Technical report

- Draft:
    - A draft of the report needs to be uploaded along with your processed signals.
    - The draft needs to be sufficiently complete for us to judge whether your system is compliant with the challenge rules.
	
- Technical Report:
    - A two page technical report must be submitted as a paper to the Cadenza-2023 Workshop (date to be confirmed).
    - Your report should include an abstract and introduction and sections on experimental setup/methodology including system information
      and model/network architecture, evaluation/results, discussion, conclusion and references.
      Please provide an estimation of the computational resources needed. You must describe any external data and pre-existing tools, software and models used.
    - You can use the ICASSP 2024 2-page template.

## 4. Where do I submit the signals?

When you have registered you will receive a link to a OneDrive to which you will be able to securely upload your signals.

Materials uploaded will be visible to the Cadenza Team but not to other entrants.

Your processed signals should be named using the conventions used by the baseline system:

* Task 1: `<Listener ID>/<Song Name>/<Listener ID>_<Song Name>_remix.wav`

These should be placed in a directory whose name is the unique team ID that you will be sent, e.g., `submission_E001` and  then packaged using `zip` or `tar` or any standard packaging tool.
