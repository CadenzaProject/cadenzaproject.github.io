## 1. What audio do I need to submit?

You must submit the following audio for all the signals in the evaluation set:
- The rebalanced stereo signal.
    - Predefined 10-second segments.
    - 16-bit
    - 32 kHz sampling rate
    - Compressed using the lossless FLAC compressor 
	- 0 dB FS corresponds to 100 dB SPL

## 2. Code

We encourage you to make your code open source.

## 3. Technical report

- Draft:
    - A draft of the technical report needs to be uploaded along with your evaluation signals.
    - The draft needs to be sufficiently complete for us to judge whether your system is compliant with the challenge rules.
	
- Technical Report:
    - A two page technical report must be submitted as a paper alongside your data.
    - Your report should include an abstract and introduction and sections on experimental setup/methodology including system information
      and model/network architecture, evaluation/results, discussion, conclusion and references.
      Please provide an estimation of the computational resources needed. You must describe any external data and pre-existing tools, software and models used.
    - You can use the ICASSP 2024 2-page template.
    - The top five systems will be invited to submit a paper to the ICASSP 2024 special session.

## 4. How will intellectual property be handled?

See [here](rules#7-intellectual-property) under Intellectual Property.
