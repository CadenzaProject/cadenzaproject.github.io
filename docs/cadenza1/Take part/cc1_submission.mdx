:::info
All teams are [required to register](./cc1_registration.mdx) prior to submission and before the registration deadline [tbc].
:::

We will be operating a two-stage submission process:

- **Stage 1**: Evaluation using HAAQI
- **Stage 2**: Evaluation using listening panel

Draft key dates:

- **1st Feb 2023**: Beta launch of challenge with software and datasets.
- **1st March 2023**: Full launch of challenge with software and datasets.
- **June 2023**: Release of evaluation data.
- **July 2023**: Competition closed. All entrants submit (i) audio for evaluation and (ii) a draft of their technical report.
- **Aug 2023**: Entrants informed which systems are going forward to the listening test evaluation stage.
- **Sept 2023**: Submit two page technical reports to Cadenza-2023 workshop.
- **Autumn 2023**: Cadenza-2023 workshop.

<!-- ## What evaluation data is provided?

The evaluation data consists of 1500 scenes. For each scene, you are provided with the signals received at each of the three microphones on the left and right hearing aid device. You will also be provided with JSON or csv formatted metadata consisting of

  1. the audiograms and DTT results for a set of listeners and
  2. a mapping of which listeners will listen to which scenes.

There will also be some clean audio examples for the target talker, that are not the same as the target utterance.

For the stage 1 HAAQI evaluation, there will be one listener per scene and the scene-listener mapping will be the same for all teams.

For the stage 2 listening test evaluation, there will be five listeners per scene and each team will have a separate scene-listener mapping. The file formats will be the same as used for the development data; for details see the [Data Overview](./Data/cc1_data_overview) page. 
-->

## What audio do I need to submit?

You must submit the audio signals produced at the output of the headphone processor (track 1) or car infotainment system (track 2) for the evaluation datasets.

Signals should be submitted as 16-bit WAV files with a 32 kHz sampling rate, and 0 dB FS corresponds to 100 dB SPL, given the capabilities of the listening test reproduction equipment.

We also encourage you to submit your simulated hearing aid code.

See the page on [listening tests](./cc1_listening_tests) for more information about the levels that can be reproduced by the listening test equipment. When playing signals to listeners we will then play them as is. The responsibility for the final signal level is therefore yours. Itâ€™s worth bearing in mind that should your signals overall seem too loud to be comfortable to a participant, they may well turn down the volume themselves.

## Technical report

- The two page technical report must be submitted as a paper to the Cadenza-2023 Workshop. An author kit and submission instructions will be made available.
- A draft of the report needs to be uploaded to the Google Drive along with your processed signals. The draft needs to be sufficiently complete for us to judge whether your system is compliant with the challenge rules.
- Your report should include an abstract and introduction and sections on experimental setup/methodology including system information and model/network architecture, evaluation/results, discussion, conclusion and references. Please provide an estimation of the computational resources needed. You must describe any external data and pre-existing tools, software and models used.

## Where do I submit the signals?

When you have registered you will receive a link to a Google Drive to which you will be able to securely upload your signals.

Materials uploaded will be visible to the Cadenza Team but not to other entrants.

<!-- ### Naming and packaging signals
I THOUGHT THE NAMING CONVENTION MIGHT NEED CHANGING HENCE COMMENTED OUT FOR NOW
Your processed signals should be named using the conventions used by the baseline system, i.e., `<Scene ID>_<Listener ID>_HA-output.wav` and explained on the [data page](/docs/cadenza1/Data/cc1_data_overview).
These should be placed in a directory whose name is the unique team ID that you will be sent, e.g., `E001` and  then packaged using `zip` or `tar` or any standard packaging tool.
The resulting file should be about 2 GB for the first round.

:::warning
Note, in order to use the Google Drive you will need to have a Google account. If you anticipate problems using Google then please make arrangements to send us the materials by other means, e.g., via a service such as WeTransfer or similar.
