### Cadenza Challenge 1 Webinar and Q&A

In May 2023, we held a webinar event to give a short introduction to the project and the tasks of this first round. 
We also did a tutorial explaining the baseline codes, the relevant functions, 
how to run each stage and, the output directory structures and formats.

The tutorial is saved in a Jupyter Books format and can be accessed on
https://www.gerardoroadabike.com/cadenza_webinar_may2023/intro.html

**Expositors:** Trevor Cox, Alinka Greasley and Gerardo Roa Dabike.
