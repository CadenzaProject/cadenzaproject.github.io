### Software

All the necessary software tools will be available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CadenzaProject) by March 2023.


We recommend installing the software first and then following the instructions in the repository's README for downloading and unpacking the data.

### Data

The data will be available to download by March 2023.

<!-- The data is available for [download here](https://mab.to/zU7TS8jJelkoD).

On the download site you will see three data packages are available,

- `clarity_CEC2_core.v1_1.tgz`  [**28 GB**] - metadata and dev set
- `clarity_CEC2_train.v1_1.tgz` [**69 GB**] - scenes for training systems
- `clarity_CEC2_hoairs.v1_0.tgz` [**144 GB**] - impulse responses for generating extended training data -->

<!-- All participants will require the **core** data package. Participants using machine learning approaches will additionally require the **train** data package. Participants wishing to extend the training set by using our provided scene rendering tools will also require the high order ambisonic impulse responses (i.e., the **hoairs** package). 

To unpack the data we recommend you follow the instructions in the [Cadenza Challenge GitHub repository](https://github.com/CadenzaProject/Cadenza). -->
