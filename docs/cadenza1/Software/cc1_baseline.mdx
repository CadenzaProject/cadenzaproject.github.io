Challenge entrants are supplied with a fully functioning baseline system. [Figure 1](#fig1) shows a simplified schematic:

- Music processing system (green box)
- This is then passed through the headphones (purple box).

- The enhancement is individualised for each listener with quantified hearing characteristics, hence there is also a system to select a random listener (white ellipse).
- The Improved audio signal that is outputted from the system is then passed to the evaluation stage (orange box). We are using the Hearing-Aid Audio Quality Index (HAAQI) as the objective metric to estimate speech intelligibility \[[1](#refs)].


## Track 1

### Diagram

Below, a schematic diagram is shown for the baseline system for the headphone listening scenario:

### Description

Music samples are taken from the [Jamendo](https://www.jamendo.com/) and [MedleyDB](https://medleydb.weebly.com/) databases. These are either already separated into "vocal", "drums", "bass, and "other" channels, or optionally (for the Jamendo samples) are given as stereo/mono signals which can later be separated.

The evaluation stage compares the processed audio and a reference (unprocessed) signal to calculate the HAAQI score.

## Track 2

### Diagram

Below, a schematic diagram is shown for the baseline system for the car listening scenario:

![Schematic diagram of the baseline system for the car listening scenario](/img/Baseline_2.png)

### Description

As in Track 1, the music samples are taken from the [Jamendo](https://www.jamendo.com/) and [MedleyDB](https://medleydb.weebly.com/) databases, and are either already separated into "vocal", "drums", "bass, and "other" channels, or optionally (for the Jamendo samples) are given as stereo/mono signals which can later be separated. 

The music samples are then fed into the Music Processor block of the car entertainment system. A level limiter is added afterwards to restrict levels to a sensible value.
The signals are then passed through the BRIR of the car (taken from the [eBrIRD](https://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/resource/ebrird/) database), and finally through a hearing aid simulator, into which the car noise is also passed.

The evaluation stage compares the processed audio and a reference (unprocessed) signal to calculate the HAAQI score.
