More details of the software will follow in Jan/Feb 2023
:::

<!--
## Car noise generator

This software generates car noise, using the car speed as input. This is provided so that entrants can generate additional samples of car noise. The system should not use the car noise signal itself to perform noise cancellation, only the metadata on car speed.

More details coming soon!


## Sample selection from track

This software selects a 10-second sample from a random point in a track. This is how samples will be selected from the evaluation data set for perceptual evaluation by the listener panel.

More details coming soon!
