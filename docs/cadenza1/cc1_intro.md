The first Cadenza challenge is about improving the perceived audio quality of recorded music for hearing-aid users.

# Overview of the challenge

There will be two different scenarios in this challenge, referred to as "Track 1" and "Track 2". Participants can submit solutions for both or just one of these.

## Track 1

This will focus on a simple and common listening setup: listening to recorded music over headphones. A hearing impaired user wearing headphones (but not their hearing aids) listens to a piece of recorded music. Your task is to process the audio to improve the perceived quality.

## Track 2

This will focus on another common, but more complex, listening setup: listening to music on a car stereo. A hearing impaired user wearing their hearing aids, sitting in a car, listens to recorded music played over the car stereo. Your task is to process the music played from the stereo to improve the perceived audio quality and reduce the effects of the car noise.
