The first Cadenza challenge is about improving the perceived audio quality of recorded music for hearing-aid users.

# Overview of the challenge

There will be two common listening scenarios: Track 1 and Track 2. You can enter one or both tracks.

## Track 1: Headphones

Someone listening to recorded music over headphones (but not their hearing aids). Your task is to process the audio to improve the perceived audio quality.

## Track 2: Car

The listener is wearing their hearing aids, sitting in a car and listening to recorded music played over the car stereo. Your task is to process the music played from the stereo to improve the perceived audio quality allowing for the presence of the car noise.
