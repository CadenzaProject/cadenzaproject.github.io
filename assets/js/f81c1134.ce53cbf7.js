This resulted in hundreds of unique attributes used to describe sound quality, of which 89 were used more than four times (see  [Fig. 1](#fig1)) and 87 were used two or three times (see [Fig. 2](#fig2)). This provided the starting point for the first Focus group which sought to identify the most important attributes and to identify ways of grouping the attributes into perceptual dimensions that could be captured in the quality metric.\\n\\nThe outcome of Focus group one was a spatial mapping of the ways in which the panel grouped attributes together which was used as a starting point for Focus group two (see [Fig. 3](#fig3)). The panel then discussed further the meaning and grouping of different terms to reach consensus about important dimensions. In February, we will carry out a third Focus group to arrive at final dimensions, how these can be defined, and how they can be rated or scored in the challenges.\\n\\nWe would like to thank our Sensory panel group for their ongoing motivation and commitment with this challenging task!\\n\\n\\n<figure id=\\"fig1\\">\\n<img width=\\"500\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'../img/sensory_blog_1.png\')} />\\n<figcaption>Figure 1, 89 terms that were used four or more times to describe the musical excerpts.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<figure id=\\"fig2\\">\\n<img width=\\"500\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'../img/sensory_blog_2.png\')} />\\n<figcaption>Figure 2, 87 terms that were used twice or three times to describe the musical excerpts.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<figure id=\\"fig3\\">\\n<img width=\\"500\\" src={useBaseUrl(\'../img/sensory_blog_3.jpg\')} />\\n<figcaption>Figure 3, starting point for focus group two, discussing the further meaning and grouping of different terms.</figcaption>\\n</figure>"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-03-welcome.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Welcome to the new Cadenza webpage.
