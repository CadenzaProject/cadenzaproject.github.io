A crude summary of what happens in commercial music production, is to create a mix where all instruments are balanced in terms of level, their frequency ranges are sculpted (with EQ) so that each instrument occupies a portion of the audio range, and their locations in the stereo image create a pleasant and discernible audio scene for the listener. Vocals usually \u201cride\u201d on top of this mix, with slightly louder levels so the lyrics are intelligible. There is often the use of artificial reverberation to create intimacy and spaciousness.

How might you approach doing an intelligent remix for someone with a hearing loss?"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Given that the underlying stems can be separated, the obvious approach would be to edit and remix these in some way that makes sense for the listener allowing for the hearing loss. We know that, in music productions, vocals are usually mixed about 4 to 6dB louder than the average level of the mix, with guitars as the next louder instruments. A mix targeting for someone with hearing loss might attempt to make the melody and lyrics more salient in the mix. The levels of rhythm back tracks such as drums and bass may be reduced relative to vocals and guitars, possibly with relative level differences going beyond the \u201cstandard\u201d 6dB. Another approach might be to remix in a way to reduce perceptual masking from bass-heavy stems on other stems. This can be achieved by reducing the level of the former or applying some form of clever dynamic equalisation such as a multiband compressor. The position of each stem on the stereo image is also a factor affecting the listening experience. Positioning \u201cimportant\u201d stems away from other \u201cmasking\u201d stems using panning in the stereo image will allow perceptual unmasking which will, potentially, help distinguish between the stems and create a more \u201cspacious\u201d stereo experience.

If the system has access to the hearing loss profile, it can target a personalised mix which will be optimised for the individual. Level and frequency modifications can take into account the frequency regions where the listener has better preserved hearing. For example, if someone has severe impairment in the high frequency range, it makes sense to reshape the audio so that most relevant information (eg: vocals and melody) is presented in the mid-frequencies. For listeners with mild to moderate hearing loss, a simple balancing of levels of instruments to appear more prominent in the best hearing frequencies would make sense.

Here, an adaptive increase of those frequencies potentially masked by the car noise, as its profile changes through speed, will ensure musical components are less masked by the noise. Moreover, as the available source signal is in stereo, another solution would be to use a \u201cmid-side\u201d technique (obtained by summing both left and right channels to obtain a mid channel and subtracting them to obtain a side channel). Mid and side channels can then be edited separately with various tools such as EQ, multiband compression or even just simple level adjustment, before converting them back to the stereo left and right channels. A simple increase of the mid-channel allows all the instruments which have been panned centrally in the stereo mix, e.g.: vocals, bass, snare, to be raised in terms of their relative level. A mix that may sound too spacious and lacking detail for a hearing impaired user can be made more defined and focused on vocals by reducing the level of the side channel before converting back to a left/right mix."),(0,a.kt)("h3",{id:"references"},"References"),(0,a.kt)("ol",null,(0,a.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/11599/Reiss%20Intelligent%20Audio%20Production%20Strategies%202014%20Published.pdf"},"P.
