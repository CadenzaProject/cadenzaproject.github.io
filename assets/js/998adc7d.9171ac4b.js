Careful attack and release settings are necessary to avoid a \u2018pumping\u2019 effect from the compressor due to the very transient nature of vocals.

Pop mixing techniques sometimes use a different or even no reverb on the vocal track, to make it stand out from the backing tracks.

In particular, a process of dereverberation applied solely to the vocal track might have an intelligibility enhancing effect as the vocal track becomes more \u2018spatially displaced\u2019 from the backing tracks. It is known that early reflections (within around 20ms) are useful in enhancing speech intelligibility, so a process that will either keep or even enhance these on the vocals might work well.

In this case, a process which inverts what a de-esser does might lead to beneficial improvements in lyric intelligibility in the mix. There are various degrees of application of such a technique.
