For example, numerous perceptual models of audio quality have been developed, such as the Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality (PEAQ), the Hearing-Aid Speech Quality Index (HASQI), and similarly the Hearing-Aid Audio Quality Index (HAAQI). These models can use software to simulate the human ear, auditory models, hearing loss, and hearing aid processing. Commonly, a degraded audio signal is compared with a reference signal in the perceptual models, and correlations between key audio features are performed to produce an evaluation metric of audio quality (e.g., ranging from 0 to 1). The HAAQI will be used to score your systems, but it is also important to collect data regarding the subjective perceptual experiences of listeners with hearing loss.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"learning_resources/Perceptual_testing/edu_PT_analysis":{"id":"learning_resources/Perceptual_testing/edu_PT_analysis","title":"Analysis","description":"Details to appear","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"learning_resources/Perceptual_testing/edu_PT_sensory_Evaluation":{"id":"learning_resources/Perceptual_testing/edu_PT_sensory_Evaluation","title":"Sensory Evaluation","description":"An important aspect of music listening is the perceptual experience of audio quality, which is often affected by hearing loss and hearing aids. Numerous studies have investigated judgments of audio quality and their underlying perceptual dimensions in normal hearing listeners; see the \u2018sound wheel\u2019 image below as an example of how audio quality might be described, using terms such as full, tinny, rough, clean, dark and bright. Despite this research, there is less work focusing on hearing loss.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"learning_resources/Software/edu_SW_python":{"id":"learning_resources/Software/edu_SW_python","title":"Getting started with Python","description":"If you\'re new to Python, there are many excellent online resources that can help you get started.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
