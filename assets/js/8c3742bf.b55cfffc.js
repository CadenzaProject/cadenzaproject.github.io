Frequency-dependent gains are applied to the filtered bands. Gains are based on an A-weighted 65 dB presentation level using [an implementation of] the CAMFIT nonlinear prescription [1]. Compression ratios were determined by the difference in prescribed outputs at 55 and 85 dB input (cf. IEC 60118, 2022) with an upper ratio limit of 6:1 imposed to avoid extreme values. Compression attack and release times (11-14 and 80-100 ms, respectively, across centre frequencies) were based on average values measured using IEC 60118 procedures in hearing aid devices [2].
